            <li>The brain is divided into three main parts: the cerebrum, brainstem, and cerebellum.</li>
            <li>Cerebrum: It consists of two main parts, the right cerebral hemisphere and the left <br>
                cerebral hemisphere, which are separated by the longitudinal fissure. <br>
                Inside the cerebrum are four cavities containing cerebrospinal fluid called ventricles, <br>
                connected by openings and channels. Cerebrospinal fluid produced by the ventricles helps <br>
                protect and reduce trauma to the brain.</li>
            <li>Brainstem: It consists of the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata. <br>
                The brainstem lies in front of the cerebellum and acts as a relay station, <br>
                transmitting information to other organs in the body.</li>
            <li>Cerebellum: Located behind the brainstem, below the cerebrum. <br>
                The cerebellum coordinates motor movements, maintains posture, and balances the body.</li>
            <li>The brain is composed of nerve cells called neurons and supporting cells called glial cells.</li>
            <li>The brain's functions include stimulation, transmission, sending and receiving nerve impulses. <br>
                It balances the internal environment, supports, nourishes.</li>
